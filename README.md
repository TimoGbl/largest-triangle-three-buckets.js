# A Javascript implementation of Largest-Triangle-Three-Buckets algorithm

Slightly modified from [Sveinn Steinarsson](https://github.com/sveinn-steinarsson)'s [flot-downsample plugin](https://github.com/sveinn-steinarsson/flot-downsample) which includes the algorithm. The purpose of this repo is to simply include algorithm without the flot plugin.
